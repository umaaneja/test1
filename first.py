Challenges in Enterprise Systems:
    Multiple technologies and frameworks (e.g., Drupal + AWS + custom microservices).
    Interconnected modules with varying responsibilities (e.g., APIs, integrations, data flows).
    Lack of centralized documentation.
Key Goals:
    Detect functional components (e.g., modules, services, APIs).
    Understand interdependencies (e.g., data flows, API calls).
    Identify edge cases and scenarios (e.g., error handling, scalability concerns).
2. Build a Knowledge Graph for Scenarios
    A Knowledge Graph Includes:
    Nodes: Modules, APIs, services, and data stores.
    Edges: Interactions (e.g., API calls, data queries, events).
    Metadata: Technologies used, integrations, dependencies, and potential risks.
