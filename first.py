I want to create a **multi-platform component diagram** for my system using Mermaid.js. Below are the details:

1. **System Overview**:
   - **System Name**: [Name of the overall system/project]
   - **Platforms**:
     - Platform 1: [E.g., Web, Mobile, Desktop, Cloud, IoT, etc.]
     - Platform 2: ...
   - **Technologies Used**:
     - Platform 1: [E.g., React, Angular, Python, etc.]
     - Platform 2: ...

2. **Main Components** (Categorized by Platforms):
   - Platform 1:
     - Component 1: [Name and description]
     - Component 2: ...
   - Platform 2:
     - Component 1: [Name and description]
     - Component 2: ...
   - Shared/Universal Components (if any):
     - Component 1: [Name and description]

3. **Relationships Across Components**:
   - Within a Platform:
     - [Component A] interacts with [Component B] via [Type of interaction]
   - Cross-Platform:
     - [Component X] (from Platform 1) interacts with [Component Y] (from Platform 2) via [Type of interaction]

4. **Groups or Subsystems** (Optional):
   - Group 1: [E.g., "Frontend" with components like [Component A, Component B]]
   - Group 2: ...

5. **Technology-Specific Details** (Optional):
   - Highlight specific libraries, frameworks, or tools used by components.
   - Example: "This service uses Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration."

6. **Style Preferences** (Optional):
   - Use specific colors for each platform or technology.
   - Group shared components with a distinct style.
   - Add notes or annotations for unique aspects of components.

7. **Other Requirements** (Optional):
   - Include a legend for platforms and technologies.
   - Exclude components irrelevant to the diagram's scope.
   - Add context, such as data flow direction or system constraints.

### Example Output
Please generate a Mermaid.js code for the component diagram based on the above information.
